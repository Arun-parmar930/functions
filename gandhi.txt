Mahatma Gandhi, born Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India,
was a leader of India's independence movement against British rule. He is known for his 
philosophy of nonviolent resistance, or Satyagraha, which inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.
Gandhi studied law in London and later worked in South Africa, where he first began his activism against racial discrimination. 
Upon returning to India, he led various campaigns against British rule, including the Non-Cooperation Movement, the Civil Disobedience 
Movement, and the Quit India Movement. His efforts were instrumental in India's eventual independence in 1947.
He promoted principles of self-reliance, simple living, and unity among different religious communities. 
His advocacy for nonviolence and truth earned him the title "Mahatma," meaning "Great Soul."
On January 30, 1948, Gandhi was assassinated by Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist who opposed his vision of religious harmony. 
Despite his death, his legacy continues to influence peace movements and leaders worldwide.
Mahatma Gandhi remains a symbol of resilience, peace, and the power of nonviolent resistance.
